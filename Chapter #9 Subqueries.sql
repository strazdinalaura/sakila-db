-- These subqueries are independent of the outer query. They do not reference any columns of the outer query.
-- The inner query executes once, produces a result, and then that result is used by the outer query.
-- It's like preparing a list (from the inner query) and then the outer query uses this list for comparison or other operations.
-- Because the inner query is independent, it's executed first.

-- Correlated Subqueries:
-- These subqueries reference columns from the outer query. The result of the inner query can be different for each row of the outer query because it's dependent on data from the outer query.
-- For each row processed by the outer query, the correlated subquery executes, using the data from the current row of the outer query.
-- It's like, for each item in the outer list, you're checking a condition that might change based on that specific item.
-- The inner (correlated) subquery is intertwined with the outer query's row-by-row processing.
