-- Correlation: The subquery is correlated with the outer query by the condition fa.actor_id = a.actor_id. This means for each actor in the outer query, the subquery checks the film_actor and film tables to see if there's a match for that specific actor with a 'G' 'PG' 'NC17' rated film.
-- EXISTS: The EXISTS keyword checks if the subquery returns any rows. If it does, it means the actor has appeared in at least one 'G' 'PG' 'NC17' rated film. If not, they haven't.
-- Output: If the actor has appeared in a 'G' rated film, the CASE expression outputs 'Y'. If not, it outputs 'N' 'PG' 'NC17'.
